# Thresholding

In **local_thresholding.py** the user can find some image thresholding techniques that can be applied to any images. Although, the code is extremely user friendly, the performances are poor when using the *plain python code*. <br /><br />
For images larger than ```1920x1080``` it is suggested to use the *cpp* code proposed in **images_manipulation.cpp**, or to use the ```vecotrized=True``` option in the python code.
